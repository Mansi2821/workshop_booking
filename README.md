## Answers:
1. What design principles guided your improvements?
I focused on clarity, consistency, and user-friendliness. The goal was to make the interface intuitive and visually appealing without changing the existing functionality. I used clean layouts, readable fonts, balanced spacing, and subtle color contrasts to guide users naturally through the content. Every element was designed to reduce clutter and help users focus on the most important information.


2. How did you ensure responsiveness across devices?
I made sure the layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes by using flexible containers, percentage-based widths, and CSS media queries. Navigation menus, tables, and cards were optimized to resize or stack appropriately on tablets and mobile devices. I continuously tested the pages on multiple screen resolutions to guarantee a seamless experience for desktop, tablet, and smartphone users.



3. What trade-offs did you make between the design and performance?
I prioritized simplicity and performance over heavy visual effects. Instead of adding large images or complex animations, I relied on lightweight CSS enhancements, subtle hover effects, and structured layouts. This ensures faster load times and a smoother experience, even on slower networks, while still improving the aesthetic appeal of the site.



4. What was the most challenging part of the task and how did you approach it?
The hardest part was making the interface modern and clean while keeping the original functionality untouched. Since I couldnâ€™t change any backend logic, I had to carefully wrap existing elements with styled containers, adjust spacing, and improve readability without breaking templates or Django tags. I approached this by working incrementally: updating one component at a time, testing in the browser, and ensuring that all Django dynamic content rendered correctly before moving on to the next section.
